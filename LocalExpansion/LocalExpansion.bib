  abstract={The Taylor expansion procedure introduced by Apagyi and Scheid (1983 J. Phys. G: Nucl. Phys. 9 73) for localization of nonlocal potentials has been re-examined and improved to include third-order corrections. The method has been applied to the real part of the nonlocal potential describing n- 40 Ca scattering. Comparison with exact results and investigation of phase shifts show that inclusion of second-order correction terms may be sufficient to obtain a quick assessment of the local space effect of the underlying nonlocal potential.}

abstract = "The Cuba library provides new implementations of four general-purpose multidimensional integration algorithms: Vegas, Suave, Divonne, and Cuhre. Suave is a new algorithm, Divonne is a known algorithm to which important details have been added, and Vegas and Cuhre are new implementations of existing algorithms with only few improvements over the original versions. All four algorithms can integrate vector integrands and have very similar Fortran, C/C++, and Mathematica interfaces. Program summary Title of program: Cuba Catalogue identifier: \{ADVH\} Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADVH Program obtainable from: \{CPC\} Program Library, Queen's University of Belfast, N.
